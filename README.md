# myTicTacToe
My first app of Tic Tac Toe

This is my first app in my learning of swift and iOS development in treehouse.

You can play Tic Tac Toe with your iPhone and IPad with this app. The computer play with you following the logic below:
1. Computer will play a move to win.
2. Computer will play a move to prevent you to win.
3. Otherwise, computer will play a random move.

The app will display a message upon end game or draw game. You can re-start the game at any time too.
